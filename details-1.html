          This fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from
          scratch and paired with the silky smooth chocolate frosting, you can't
          beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration!
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you a box mix yellow cake person? Or a from-scratch yellow cake
          person?

            Truth to be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that
            always-moist-and-fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box cake
            mix, but at the same time, we also love homemade, right?!
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me aLONG time to find a homemade yellow cake that I really,
            really loved. Box cake mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy
            and moist yellow cakes, and the ones I've had from bakeries have been
            great as well, but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no
            matter how many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I haven't had the same
            issue with chocolate cakes! See: Snickers Cake - the base recipe for
            all of my chocolate cakes!)
          </p>
          <p>
            Many were to dense, to dry, to chiffon-like, to fussy in their
            preparation. I just wanted a fantastic yellow cake recipe I could use
            for birthday cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicious. I
            came across this recipe from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet
            another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday
          </p>
          <p>This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years</p>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my
            hand mixer , there's nothing fussy about the ingredients or
            preparation and it produces an absolutely perfect yellow cake . The
            layers are light but sturdy , buttery and moist , and the ideal base
            for your very favorite chocolate frosting
          </p>
          <p>
            I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate
            cupcakes , and it was a wonderful companion to this cake . The
            frosting is more buttery than sugary , satiny smooth and full of rich
            chocolate flavor It glides on like a dream !
          </p>

            Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking so many
            cakes can turn out to dry, too crumbly, too dense too cornbread -
            like, and I have one major piece of advice for ensuring yellow cake
            perfection:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature" ARE
              ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The totally been there and have used still - cool butter, eggs or
            dairy in a recipe when I'm in a hurry, be's actually very important
            here. Having all of those ingredients a room temperature ensures that
            they emulsify which traps all on the batter and once in the over, that
            air expands and produces fluffy cake
          </p>
          <p>
            Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes
            together well and is ultra smooth, which keeps the resulting cake from
            being crumbly or cornbread - like
          </p>
